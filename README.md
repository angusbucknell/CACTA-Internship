# CACTA internship project
This repository forms my internship project within the [Catoni Lab](https://catonilab.com/) (University of Birmingham), which focuses on plant epigenetics and genome plasticity.

The project investigates known CACTA transposable elements (TEs) found in *A. thaliana* for equivalents within *Q. robur* and other hardwood tree species.
